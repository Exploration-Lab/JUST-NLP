Recently, the legal system in many populous coun-
tries (e.g. India) has been inundated with many
pending cases. For example, as per India’s National
Judicial Data Grid (National Judicial Data Grid,
2021), there are about 44 million pending cases at
various courts in India. Legal systems have been
established to ensure, at the very minimum, order
and fairness in society, and to safeguard fundamen-
tal human rights; however, as the legal maxim goes
“justice delayed is justice denied,” such a huge pen-
dency leads to the denial of the fundamental right
to justice. Many of these backlogs can be attributed
to the usage of manual and inefficient processes.
There is a lot of information, and it is distributed,
but the legal system lacks the technology to manage
this distributed information, organize it, and extract
knowledge from it. In the past, legal practitioners
have been mainly alien to the use of technology.
Most tasks (e.g., retrieving prior cases, classifying
documents, etc.) have been done manually or with
limited automation. However, these approaches
are not scalable, given the large number of docu-
ments. There is an imminent need for AI-enabled
automated systems to process legal documents and
help augment legal procedures.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers focused on Legal NLP to promote research and discussion in the area of legal NLP.
