### JUST-NLP 2025: Workshop on NLP for Empowering Justice

**Co-located with the premier conference IJCNLP-AACL 2025**  
**Date:** 24th December 2025  
**Venue:** Victor Menezes Convention Centre (VMCC), IIT Bombay, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400076, India

### <div style={{ display: "none" }}></div>

We are pleased to invite participation in the shared tasks organized as part of the JUST-NLP Workshop. This workshop aims to foster research and innovation in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the legal domain, with a particular focus on practical and impactful applications in the large, multilingual legal system of India.

### <div style={{ display: "none" }}></div>
Legal systems in highly populous countries such as India are currently facing a crisis of judicial pendency. As per the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), India alone has over **44 million pending cases** across courts. This backlog, primarily stemming from manual and inefficient processes, leads to the denial of timely justice, undermining the rights the legal system is meant to protect. AI-enabled automated systems can offer scalable solutions to assist legal professionals, reduce repetitive work, and improve access to justice. Despite significant progress in NLP for general domains in India, the legal domain remains under-explored due to its complexity, domain-specific language, and limited annotated datasets.

### <div style={{ display: "none" }}></div>
This JUST-NLP 2025 workshop aims to bring together AI researchers, legal professionals, and technologists to advance this area of applied NLP research. As part of this effort, we are launching **2 shared tasks**, designed to address high-impact problems in legal document processing.


## üß† Details of Shared Tasks


### üìù Task 1. Legal Summarization (L-SUMM)

- **Objective:** Generate abstractive summaries of case judgments from Indian courts.
- **Challenges:** Requires legal domain-specific knowledge, understanding of legal reasoning, and coherent abstraction.

- **Language covered:** English (EN)
- **Evaluation Metrics:** ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L and BERTScore
- **Reading materials:** Please refer to the following research papers for more details about legal summarization:
