# Call for Papers

## Overview

Recently, the legal system in many populous countries (e.g., India) has been inundated with many pending cases. For example, as per India's National Judicial Data Grid [1], there are about 44 million pending cases at various courts in India. Legal systems have been established to ensure, at the very minimum, order and fairness in society, and to safeguard fundamental human rights; however, as the legal maxim goes "justice delayed is justice denied," such a huge pendency leads to the denial of the fundamental right to justice. Many of these backlogs can be attributed to manual and inefficient processes. There is a lot of information, and it is distributed, but the legal system lacks the technology to manage this distributed information, organize it, and extract knowledge from it. In the past, legal practitioners have been mainly alien to the use of technology. Most tasks (e.g., retrieving prior cases, classifying documents, etc.) have been done manually or with limited automation. However, these approaches are not scalable, given the large number of documents. There is an imminent need for AI-enabled automated systems to process legal documents and help augment legal procedures.

Just-NLP is exactly such a workshop that provides a platform to the Artificial Intelligence community to promote research and discussion in the area of legal NLP. Its purpose is to solicit both matured and early-staged research work from the AI community, aiming to cover topics related to the AI-based solutions for various domain-specific legal challenges. We welcome submissions describing original work on novel applications of AI or NLP techniques to the Legal domain.
